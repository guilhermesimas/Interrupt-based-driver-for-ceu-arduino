## Interrupt-based drivers and libraries for Céu-Arduino

**Organization:** LabLua

**Mentor:** Francisco Santanna

**Student:** Guilherme Simas

### Project Description

Developing interrupt-based drivers and libraries for Arduino chips and peripherals for the Céu-Arduino language, in order to replace current functions and libraries which freeze the application while executing.

This project will make an overall contribution not only to the development of the Céu language but to the Arduino and Embedded Systems community as well.

This repository contains biweekly reports regarding the project's progress. It also contains development files which were relevant to the development of the drivers and libraries but do not belong in the final build.

For the current drivers and libraries builds, refer to the [ceu-arduino repository](https://github.com/guilhermesimas/ceu-arduino).
