Interrupt-based Driver for Ceu-Arduino

This repository contains documentation and development files for the ongoing development of a driver for microcontroller Arduino using ceu-arduino language developed by LabLua and Francisco Santanna <github.com/fsantanna>

The goal of this project is to develop a library for ceu-arduino which replaces current Arduino functions that block the application while executing. The idea for this project originates from Google Summer of Code's LabLua's project suggestion <http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/gsoc/ideas2017.html>
